This is a simple demo that lets you convert an arbitrary number of PNGs and create an album that you can browse on a Game Boy, and you can press the A button to attempt to print each picture with a Game Boy Printer. Holding B will cancel a print attempt.

Pictures should be 160 pixels wide, a multiple of 16 pixels tall, and be indexed images with the palette of white, light gray, dark gray, black, in that order. The exact color values does not matter.
